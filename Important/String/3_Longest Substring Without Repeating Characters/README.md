# [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)


## 題目

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
給一個字串s,找到最長的長度在沒有重複的字母的情況下的子串


 

Example 1:

```

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

```
Example 2:

```

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring
```

Example 4:
```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= strs.length <= 104
0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
strs[i] consists of lower-case English letters.
